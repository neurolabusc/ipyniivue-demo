# ipyniivue-demo

A minimal demo repository for `ipyniivue` with a Jupyter Notebook that shows multiple examples in tabs (multiplanar view, opacity slider, toggle visibility).

Usage:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neurolabusc/ipyniivue-demo.git
cd ipyniivue-demo
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
# open demo.ipynb
```

The notebook contains several ipynb files (notebooks) that you can run to see NiiVue's capabilities and interactively adapt for your needs.
